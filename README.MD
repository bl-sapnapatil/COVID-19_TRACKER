    npm install
    ```

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:1337`!

## 🧐 What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories you'll see in a COVID19 Tracker project.

    .
    ├── node_modules
    ├── config
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── .prettierrc
    ├── index.js
    ├── LICENSE
    ├── package-lock.json
    ├── package.json
    └── README.md

1.  **`/node_modules`**: This directory contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages) are automatically installed.

2.  **`/server`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the back-end of your site.

3.  **`.gitignore`**: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.

4.  **`.prettierrc`**: This is a configuration file for [Prettier](https://prettier.io/). Prettier is a tool to help keep the formatting of your code consistent.

5.  **`LICENSE`**: COVID19 Tracker is licensed under the MIT license.

6. **`package-lock.json`** (See `package.json` below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. **(You won’t change this file directly).**

7. **`package.json`**: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

8. **`README.md`**: A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
